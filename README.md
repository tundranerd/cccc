# cccc - A tool/library for measurement of **C**ognitive **C**omplexity and **C**yclomatic **C**omplexity

- A fast CLI — a **single `cccc` binary** — that measures **Cognitive Complexity**
  (SonarSource / G. Ann Campbell) and **Cyclomatic Complexity** (McCabe). Written
  in Rust. It routes each file to the right front-end by its extension, so one run
  can analyze a mixed-language tree. Various languages ship today, all sharing the
  same engine, flags, and output format:
  - **TypeScript / JavaScript** (`--lang es`), via the [oxc](https://oxc.rs)
    parser. Analyzes `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`.
  - **Rust** (`--lang rust`), via the [syn](https://docs.rs/syn) parser. `.rs`.
  - **Go** (`--lang go`), via the [gosyn](https://docs.rs/gosyn) parser. `.go`.
  - **PHP** (`--lang php`), via the [php-rs-parser](https://docs.rs/php-rs-parser)
    parser. `.php`.
  - **Ruby** (`--lang ruby`), via the [ruby-prism](https://docs.rs/ruby-prism)
    parser (Ruby's official Prism parser). `.rb`.
  - **Scheme** (`--lang scheme`), R7RS-small, via the
    [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression reader. `.scm`, `.ss`, `.sld`.
    Its child dialect **Racket** (`--lang racket`, `.rkt`/`.rktl`/`.rktd`) rides
    the same tolerant reader, with `match` and the `for` comprehension family
    scored on top of R7RS.
  - **Common Lisp** (`--lang commonlisp`), via the
    [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression reader. `.lisp`, `.lsp`, `.cl`.
  - **Emacs Lisp** (`--lang emacslisp`), via the
    [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression reader. `.el`.
  - **Clojure** (`--lang clojure`), via the
    [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression reader. `.clj`, `.cljs`, `.cljc`.
  - **Kotlin** (`--lang kotlin`), via the
    [exoego/tree-sitter-kotlin](https://github.com/exoego/tree-sitter-kotlin)
    grammar (a fork of the fwcd tree-sitter Kotlin grammar with fixes for
    modern-Kotlin constructs). Analyzes `.kt`, `.kts`.
  - **Python** (`--lang python`), via the official
    [tree-sitter-python](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python)
    grammar. Analyzes `.py`, `.pyi`.
  - **Zig** (`--lang zig`), via the pure-Rust
    [zigsyn](https://docs.rs/zigsyn) parser. Analyzes `.zig`.
  - **C** (`--lang c`), via the official
    [tree-sitter-c](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c) grammar.
    Analyzes `.c`, `.h`.
  - **C++** (`--lang cpp`, aliases `c++`/`cxx`), via the official
    [tree-sitter-cpp](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp) grammar.
    Analyzes `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.hpp`, `.hh`, `.hxx`, `.h++`, `.tpp`,
    `.ipp` (`.h` is claimed by C, since extension routing needs disjoint
    claims — see [C++](#c---lang-cpp) for routing `.h` to C++). Shares its
    lowering for everything C and C++ have in common with `cccc-c`, via
    `cccc-clike`.
  - **Perl** (`--lang perl`), via the community-maintained
    [tree-sitter-perl](https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl)
    grammar. Analyzes `.pl`, `.pm`, `.t`.
  - **Swift** (`--lang swift`), via the
    [alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift](https://github.com/alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift)
    grammar. Analyzes `.swift`.
  - **Java** (`--lang java`), via the official
    [tree-sitter-java](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java)
    grammar. Analyzes `.java`.
  - **Dart** (`--lang dart`), via the
    [nielsenko/tree-sitter-dart](https://github.com/nielsenko/tree-sitter-dart)
    grammar. Analyzes `.dart`.
  - **Scala** (`--lang scala`), via the official
    [tree-sitter-scala](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-scala)
    grammar. Analyzes `.scala`, `.sc`.
  - **Shell** (`--lang shell`, aliases `sh`/`bash`/`posix`/`ksh`), POSIX `sh`
    and `bash`, via the official
    [tree-sitter-bash](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash)
    grammar. Analyzes `.sh`, `.bash`, `.bats`, `.ksh`, `.command`.
  - **Zsh** (`--lang zsh`), via the
    [georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh](https://github.com/georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh)
    grammar. Analyzes `.zsh`.
- A Rust library for calculating cognitive and cyclomatic complexity in a language-agnostic way

## Workspace layout

The complexity engine is split from the language parser so it can be reused as a
library and extended to other languages:

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| [`cccc-core`](crates/cccc-core) | Language-agnostic engine: a normalized IR (`ir::Node`), the scoring rules (`engine::analyze`), and the result/aggregation types. Depends only on `serde`. |
| [`cccc-cli`](crates/cccc-cli) | The unified **`cccc` binary**. Owns argument parsing, config-file handling, file walking, parallelism, and output rendering, and holds the registry of bundled languages (`lang::LANGUAGES`) that routes each file to its adapter. |
| [`cccc-es`](crates/cccc-es) | ECMAScript/TypeScript adapter **library**: lowers the oxc AST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + oxc — **no CLI dependencies**, so embedding it stays lightweight. |
| [`cccc-rs`](crates/cccc-rs) | Rust adapter **library**: lowers the [syn](https://docs.rs/syn) AST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + syn — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-go`](crates/cccc-go) | Go adapter **library**: lowers the [gosyn](https://docs.rs/gosyn) AST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + gosyn — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-php`](crates/cccc-php) | PHP adapter **library**: lowers the [php-rs-parser](https://docs.rs/php-rs-parser) AST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + php-rs-parser / php-ast — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-rb`](crates/cccc-rb) | Ruby adapter **library**: lowers the [ruby-prism](https://docs.rs/ruby-prism) AST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + ruby-prism — **no CLI dependencies**. Note: ruby-prism is an FFI binding to the vendored Prism C source, so building this crate (unlike the others) needs a C99 compiler and libclang. |
| [`cccc-scheme`](crates/cccc-scheme) | Scheme (R7RS-small) + Racket adapter **library**: lowers the [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression tree into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + lispexp (pure Rust) — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-lisp-kit`](crates/cccc-lisp-kit) | Shared **lowering kit** for the Lisp-family adapters: the collector stack, the `walk_regions` code-vs-data traversal, and logical folding. A dialect adapter supplies just a reader preset + a head-symbol dispatch table. Re-exports `cccc-core`'s IR and the pure-Rust lispexp reader. |
| [`cccc-lisp`](crates/cccc-lisp) | Lisp-family adapter **library** (Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, …) built on `cccc-lisp-kit`. Its `Dialect` API also analyzes Scheme/Clojure by delegating to `cccc-scheme`/`cccc-clojure` (no duplicated lowering). **No CLI dependencies.** |
| [`cccc-clojure`](crates/cccc-clojure) | Clojure adapter **library**: lowers the [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression tree into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + lispexp (pure Rust) — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-scheme`](crates/cccc-scheme) | Scheme (R7RS-small) adapter **library**: lowers the [lispexp](https://docs.rs/lispexp) S-expression tree into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + lispexp (pure Rust) — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-kt`](crates/cccc-kt) | Kotlin adapter **library**: lowers the [exoego/tree-sitter-kotlin](https://github.com/exoego/tree-sitter-kotlin) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Kotlin grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Note: the grammar ships C source compiled by `cc`, so building this crate needs a C compiler (but not libclang, unlike `cccc-rb`). Not published to crates.io (the grammar is a git dependency); `cccc-cli` includes it via its default `kotlin` feature. |
| [`cccc-py`](crates/cccc-py) | Python adapter **library**: lowers the official [tree-sitter-python](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Python grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-zig`](crates/cccc-zig) | Zig adapter **library**: lowers the pure-Rust [zigsyn](https://docs.rs/zigsyn) AST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + zigsyn — **no CLI dependencies or C toolchain**. |
| [`cccc-c`](crates/cccc-c) | C adapter **library**: lowers the official [tree-sitter-c](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the C grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-clike`](crates/cccc-clike) | Shared **lowering** for the C-family adapters: `tree-sitter-cpp`'s grammar is a superset of `tree-sitter-c`'s, so `cccc-c` and `cccc-cpp` both construct a `cccc_clike::SharedBuilder` (tagged `Language::C`/`Language::Cpp`) instead of duplicating the lowering for what they share (functions, `if`, loops, `switch`, jumps, logical folding, preprocessor conditionals, calls). C++-only constructs (lambdas, `catch`, range-`for`) are gated on the language tag in the same `visit`. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter — no grammar crate, no CLI dependencies. |
| [`cccc-cpp`](crates/cccc-cpp) | C++ adapter **library**: lowers the official [tree-sitter-cpp](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR via `cccc-clike`. Depends only on `cccc-core` + `cccc-clike` + tree-sitter + the C++ grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. |
| [`cccc-pl`](crates/cccc-pl) | Perl adapter **library**: lowers the [tree-sitter-perl](https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Perl grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-swift`](crates/cccc-swift) | Swift adapter **library**: lowers the [alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift](https://github.com/alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Swift grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-java`](crates/cccc-java) | Java adapter **library**: lowers the official [tree-sitter-java](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Java grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-dart`](crates/cccc-dart) | Dart adapter **library**: lowers the [nielsenko/tree-sitter-dart](https://github.com/nielsenko/tree-sitter-dart) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Dart grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. The grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-scala`](crates/cccc-scala) | Scala adapter **library**: lowers the official [tree-sitter-scala](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-scala) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Scala grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-sh`](crates/cccc-sh) | Shell (POSIX `sh` / `bash`) adapter **library**: lowers the official [tree-sitter-bash](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR. Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter + the Bash grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |
| [`cccc-shell-kit`](crates/cccc-shell-kit) | Shared **lowering** for the shell-family adapters: `tree-sitter-zsh` is a reworking of the bash grammar whose control-flow skeleton is nearly identical, so `cccc-sh` and `cccc-zsh` both drive one `cccc_shell_kit::SharedBuilder` (the few zsh-only arms are gated on the dialect). Depends only on `cccc-core` + tree-sitter — no grammar crate, no CLI dependencies. |
| [`cccc-zsh`](crates/cccc-zsh) | Zsh adapter **library**: lowers the [georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh](https://github.com/georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh) CST into `cccc-core`'s IR via `cccc-shell-kit`. Depends only on `cccc-core` + `cccc-shell-kit` + tree-sitter + the zsh grammar — **no CLI dependencies**. Like `cccc-kt`/`cccc-py`, the grammar's C source is compiled by `cc`, so building needs a C compiler (no libclang). |

Each adapter is a standalone library so that a consumer who only wants the
metrics pulls in just that adapter (+ `cccc-core` + its parser), never clap /
ignore / rayon. The `cccc` binary depends on all of them and dispatches by
extension.

To support another language: (1) add an adapter crate that lowers its AST into
`cccc_core::ir::Node` and calls `cccc_core::engine::analyze`, then (2) register
it with one entry in `cccc-cli`'s `lang::LANGUAGES` (and add the dependency) —
no new binary, and no reimplementing the metrics or the CLI. `cccc-es` (oxc),
`cccc-rs` (syn), `cccc-go` (gosyn), `cccc-php` (php-rs-parser), `cccc-rb`
(ruby-prism), `cccc-kt` / `cccc-py` / `cccc-pl` (tree-sitter), `cccc-swift` (tree-sitter), `cccc-c` / `cccc-cpp` (tree-sitter),
`cccc-java` (tree-sitter), `cccc-dart` (tree-sitter), `cccc-scala` (tree-sitter), `cccc-sh` / `cccc-zsh` (tree-sitter), `cccc-scheme` (lispexp), `cccc-clojure` (lispexp), `cccc-lisp` (lispexp, Common Lisp / Emacs Lisp / …),
and `cccc-zig` (zigsyn) are the reference adapters: same shape, different parser.
The Lisp-family adapters share their lowering skeleton via `cccc-lisp-kit`;
`cccc-c` and `cccc-cpp` share theirs via `cccc-clike`; and `cccc-sh` and
`cccc-zsh` share theirs via `cccc-shell-kit`.

**See [docs/ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md](docs/ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md) for the full
step-by-step guide**, including the IR-node reference table, the
logical-operator folding rule, and how to test the adapter.

```rust
use cccc_core::{engine::analyze, ir::Node};

let f = Node::Function {
    name: "f".into(), kind: "function".into(), line: 1,
    body: vec![Node::Branch { test: vec![], then: vec![], alternate: None }],
};
let report = analyze("example", &[f], vec![]);
assert_eq!(report.functions[0].cognitive, 1);  // one `if`
```

## Install / build

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows are attached to each
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/moznion/cccc/releases). To build from source:

```sh
cargo build --release
# single binary at ./target/release/cccc
```

Or install from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install cccc-cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> The crates.io build does **not** support Kotlin. `cccc-kt` depends on a Kotlin
> grammar that is only available from git, and crates.io rejects git
> dependencies, so `cccc-kt` is not published and `cccc-cli` is published without
> its (default) `kotlin` feature. Use a GitHub Release binary or build from this
> repository to analyze Kotlin.

## Usage

```sh
cccc <paths...> [options]
```

One binary handles every language. Pass one or more files or directories;
directories are walked recursively (respecting `.gitignore`, always skipping
`node_modules`). Each file is dispatched to the right front-end by its
extension, so a directory mixing `.ts`, `.rs`, `.go`, and `.php` is analyzed in
a single run. Restrict the languages with `--lang` (e.g. `--lang go,rust`).

A file with **no extension** is recognized by its `#!` interpreter line (a
shebang), so `bin/deploy` starting with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is analyzed just
like `deploy.sh`. Detection is deliberately independent of the executable bit:
non-executable scripts (sourced, or invoked via an interpreter) count too, and
the mode is meaningless on Windows. An explicit extension always wins over the
shebang, and an explicit `--ext` filter disables shebang discovery (the
extension set was chosen deliberately). A `zsh` shebang routes to the `zsh`
adapter; `sh`/`bash`/`dash`/`ksh` route to the shell adapter. A file whose
shebang names no bundled language is skipped.

Output is **JSON by default** — compact, on one line, ready to pipe into `jq`
or an artifact store; `--pretty` prints the same document indented.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--lang LIST` | Restrict analysis to these languages (comma-separated; canonical names or aliases, e.g. `es`,`rust`/`rs`,`go`,`php`). Default: all |
| `--exclude-lang LIST` | Exclude these languages (comma-separated). The inverse of `--lang`; applied to all languages, or to `--lang`'s set when both are given |
| `--config PATH` | Use this config file instead of discovering one (must exist) |
| `--no-config` | Do not look for or load a `cccc.toml` config file |
| `--table` | Human-readable table instead of JSON |
| `--ext EXTS \| LANG=EXTS` | Extensions to analyze. Global form `--ext ts,tsx` filters across all languages; per-language form `--ext es=ts,tsx` overrides that language's extensions and routes them to it. Repeatable |
| `--exclude GLOB` | Exclude files matching a glob (repeatable) |
| `--max-cognitive N` | Exit non-zero if any function's cognitive complexity exceeds N |
| `--max-cyclomatic N` | Exit non-zero if any function's cyclomatic complexity exceeds N |
| `--min N` | Only report functions with complexity >= N |
| `--top-cognitive N` | Show only the N most cognitively-complex functions, as a flat cross-file ranking |
| `--top-cyclomatic N` | Show only the N most cyclomatically-complex functions, as a flat cross-file ranking |
| `--no-ignore` | Do not respect `.gitignore` when walking directories |
| `--cache` | Cache results and reuse them for files unchanged since the last run |
| `--cache-file PATH` | Where to keep the results cache (implies `--cache`). Default: `.cccc.cache` next to the config file, or in the current directory |
| `--no-cache` | Do not use the results cache, even if the config file enables it |
| `--print-cache-file` | Print the resolved cache path (nothing when disabled) and exit; for tooling |
| `--pretty` | Pretty-print the JSON output (default is compact, one line) |
| `-j, --jobs N` | Number of files to analyze in parallel (default: logical CPU count) |

### Configuration file

Recurring options can be stored in a `cccc.toml` file so they don't have to be
repeated on every run. By default `cccc` discovers one by walking up from the
current directory, looking for `cccc.toml` (then `.cccc.toml`) in each ancestor;
`--config PATH` selects an explicit file and `--no-config` disables discovery.

Resolution precedence is **CLI flag > config file > built-in default**: anything
passed on the command line always wins. Supported keys (all optional):

```toml
# cccc.toml
languages         = ["es", "go"]        # same as --lang
exclude-languages = ["php"]             # same as --exclude-lang
exclude           = ["dist/**", "**/*.test.ts"]
table         = false
max-cognitive = 15
max-cyclomatic = 10
min           = 1
no-ignore     = false
jobs          = 8
pretty        = false               # indented JSON instead of the compact default
cache         = false               # reuse results for unchanged files
cache-file    = ".cccc.cache"       # cache location (does not enable by itself)

# Per-language extension overrides. Each entry replaces that language's default
# extensions (and routes those extensions to it). Keyed by a language's name or
# alias; languages without an entry keep their defaults.
[ext]
es = ["ts", "tsx"]      # analyze only .ts/.tsx as ECMAScript (not .js, .mjs, …)
go = ["go", "tmpl"]     # also route a custom .tmpl extension to the Go front-end
```

The config-file `ext` is a **per-language table**: it both narrows/extends which
extensions a language claims and determines how a custom extension is routed.
The same per-language form is available on the command line as
`--ext LANG=ext,ext` (which overrides the config's entry for that language),
alongside the global filter form `--ext ext,ext`.

(`--top-cognitive`/`--top-cyclomatic` and the input paths are command-line only.)

`--top-cognitive` and `--top-cyclomatic` are mutually exclusive. In top mode the
output is a ranking (`{ "metric", "top": [...], "summary" }`) instead of the
per-file `files` array; each entry carries its own `path` and `line`. The
`summary` still reflects the full population.

`--exclude` takes a glob pattern and may be given multiple times. Each pattern is
matched both against a file's path relative to the directory you passed (so
`dist/**` is anchored at that root) and against its file name alone (so
`*.test.ts` matches at any depth without a `**/` prefix). `*` does not cross `/`;
use `**` to span directories. Brace alternation is supported, e.g.
`**/*.{test,spec}.ts`. Excluded files are dropped whether found by walking a
directory or named explicitly on the command line. An invalid pattern is an error
(exit code 2). This is independent of `--no-ignore` and `.gitignore` handling.

### Results cache

`--cache` (or `cache = true` in `cccc.toml`) makes repeat runs reuse the
previous results for files that haven't changed, re-analyzing only what did.
The output is byte-for-byte identical to an uncached run: the cache is an
accelerator, never a source of errors — anything unexpected (a missing,
corrupt, or version-mismatched cache file) just degrades to a full run. It
pays off wherever cccc runs repeatedly over a mostly-unchanged tree: watch
loops, pre-commit hooks, editor integrations, and CI. On large monorepos,
warm runs measure ~3× (TS/JS via oxc) to ~17× (tree-sitter languages such as
C) faster than cold ones — numbers and method in
[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md).

An entry is reused only when it provably still describes the file's current
content, checked cheapest-first:

1. **stat** — size and mtime unchanged: trusted without reading the file.
   The steady local path; a fully warm run does nothing but stat.
2. **git's index** — the mtime moved, but git calls the file clean and the
   index's blob SHA matches the one recorded at analysis time: still no
   read. One `git ls-files`/`git status` pair answers for the whole tree,
   which is what keeps fresh CI checkouts (every mtime reset) warm. git is
   consulted only after a stat check has failed, and never trusted beyond
   content: dirty or untracked files, non-git trees, and any git failure at
   all fall through to step 3.
3. **content re-hash** — the file is read and its blob SHA re-derived from
   the bytes; the final authority, and the same value step 2 compares
   without reading. A mismatch means the content really changed, and only
   then is the file re-analyzed. (The blob SHA is SHA-1 — the same
   non-adversarial, per-path content comparison git itself rests on, not a
   cryptographic boundary.)

A hit that needed step 2 or 3 gets its refreshed mtime written back, so the
next run takes the stat path again. Entries are also keyed to the analyzing
language (`--ext` re-routing must not resurface another language's scores),
and the whole cache to the cccc version that wrote it.

The cache lives in `.cccc.cache` next to the config file (so runs from any
subdirectory share it), or where `--cache-file` points; add it to
`.gitignore`. It needs no maintenance beyond that: every run rewrites it to
match exactly the current tree — deleted files' entries are pruned, and its
size stays proportional to the project, not its history — and deleting the
file at any time is always safe (the next run is simply cold).

#### In CI

The git-index check is what makes the cache effective in CI, where every
checkout resets every mtime: persist the cache file across runs and each run
validates unchanged files off git's index instead of re-parsing them —
measured 1.6–9.6× faster than a cold run (see BENCHMARK.md). Correctness
never depends on which commit (or how stale a run) the restored cache came
from: every entry is checked content-to-content. Under `CI=…` (GitHub
Actions sets it) the git subprocesses start early so their latency hides
behind file discovery.

On GitHub Actions, [cccc-action](https://github.com/moznion/cccc-action)
wires the persistence up for you when the config sets `cache = true`. Wiring
it by hand looks like:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .cccc.cache
    key: cccc-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: cccc-
- run: cccc --cache --max-cognitive 15 src/
```

Tooling that needs the resolved cache location up front (the way
cccc-action does) can ask `cccc --print-cache-file`, which prints the path
the current config resolves to — or nothing when caching is disabled — and
exits.

### Examples

```sh
# JSON for one file
cccc src/app.ts

# Pretty table for a directory (any mix of supported languages)
cccc --table src/

# Only Go and Rust files under a mixed tree
cccc --lang go,rust .

# Everything except PHP
cccc --exclude-lang php .

# Analyze only .ts/.tsx as ECMAScript (not .js, .mjs, …)
cccc --ext es=ts,tsx src/

# CI gate: fail if any function exceeds cognitive complexity 15
cccc --max-cognitive 15 src/

# The 10 most cognitively-complex functions across the project
cccc --top-cognitive 10 src/

# Skip build output and test files
cccc --exclude 'dist/**' --exclude '**/*.{test,spec}.ts' src/

# Limit parallelism to 4 workers (default is the logical CPU count)
cccc -j 4 src/

# Recurring runs: reuse results for files unchanged since the last run
cccc --cache src/
```

Files are analyzed in parallel. The worker count defaults to the number of
logical CPUs and can be capped with `-j/--jobs`; the output is identical
regardless of the worker count.

## GitHub Action

A composite action to install and run `cccc`  in CI lives in its own repository:
[moznion/cccc-action](https://github.com/moznion/cccc-action).

```yaml
- uses: moznion/cccc-action@v1
  with:
    path: src/           # analyze this; thresholds come from cccc.toml
```

Like thresholds, caching is driven by the config: when `cccc.toml` sets
`cache = true`, the action persists the [results cache](#results-cache)
across runs on its own (via `actions/cache` — no workflow wiring needed).

An example GitHub Actions workflow for continuously measuring complexity with [k1LoW/octocov](https://github.com/k1LoW/octocov) is available at [.github/workflows/complexity.yml](./.github/workflows/complexity.yml).

## Output shape (JSON)

An object with `files` (per-file reports) and `summary` (a whole-project
rollup). Each function is measured independently and nested functions appear
under `children`. A file's totals sum every function at every depth plus
module-level code.

The `summary` is computed over every function in every file (all nesting
depths). Because complexity is right-skewed, it reports the distribution
(`sum`/`max`/`median`/`p90`/`p95`) rather than a mean — the percentiles describe
the tail where refactoring candidates live. It is unaffected by `--min`.

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/app.ts",
      "cognitive": 10,
      "cyclomatic": 10,
      "functions": [
        {
          "name": "handleRequest",
          "kind": "function",
          "line": 10,
          "cognitive": 7,
          "cyclomatic": 4,
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "file_count": 1,
    "function_count": 3,
    "parse_error_count": 0,
    "parse_error_file_count": 0,
    "cognitive":  { "sum": 10, "max": 7, "median": 2, "p90": 7, "p95": 7 },
    "cyclomatic": { "sum": 10, "max": 4, "median": 3, "p90": 4, "p95": 4 }
  }
}
```

### Parse errors

A file that fails to parse cleanly is still measured from whatever the parser
recovered, and its `parse_errors` (an array of messages, omitted when empty)
appears on that file's entry. The `summary` aggregates them — `parse_error_count`
(total errors), `parse_error_file_count` (affected files), and
`parse_error_files` (the affected paths, omitted when empty) — so a partial
parse can't go unnoticed without inspecting every file entry, even in `--top-*`
mode where per-file entries aren't emitted at all:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/broken.py",
      "parse_errors": ["syntax error at line 6"],
      ...
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "parse_error_count": 1,
    "parse_error_file_count": 1,
    "parse_error_files": ["src/broken.py"],
    ...
  }
}
```

In `--table` mode the aggregate count is printed in the summary block, and a
warning listing each affected file (with its error count) goes to stderr so it
isn't lost in a long table:

```console
$ cccc --table src/ >/dev/null
cccc: warning: 1 parse error(s) in 1 file(s); results for those files may be incomplete:
cccc:   src/broken.py (1)
```

> Note: the top level is an object (`{ files, summary }`), so to post-process
> the per-file array with `jq`, start from `.files` — e.g.
> `cccc src/ | jq '.files | sort_by(-.cognitive)'`.

## Benchmark

On [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)'s `packages/zod/src` (286 `.ts`
files, 68,357 LOC), median wall-clock and peak memory over 5 runs on an Apple
M4 Pro:

| Tool | Metrics | Time | Peak RSS |
|------|---------|-----:|---------:|
| **cccc** (ECMAScript) | cognitive + cyclomatic, per-function, full AST | **15.5 ms** | **12.5 MB** |
| ESLint + SonarJS | cognitive + cyclomatic, per-function, full AST | 1,807 ms (**117× slower**) | 604 MB (48× more) |
| lizard | cyclomatic only, heuristic parser | 1,413 ms (91× slower) | 45.7 MB |
| scc | coarse per-file keyword count, no AST | 8.3 ms (1.9× faster) | 13.9 MB |

Among tools that do the same job — both metrics, per-function, over a real AST —
cccc is **~117× faster than ESLint+SonarJS** (the only other tool that computes
cognitive complexity) and uses ~48× less memory. `scc` is faster only because it
never parses: it counts keywords per file, with no AST, no per-function data, and
no cognitive complexity.

See **[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)** for the full methodology, the verify-then-time
harness, per-run numbers, function-count sanity checks, and caveats.

## Metric rules

**Cyclomatic (McCabe):** base 1 per function; +1 for each `if`/`else if`,
ternary, `for`/`for-in`/`for-of`/`while`/`do-while`, `case` (excluding
`default`), `catch`, each `&&`/`||`/`??`, and each explicit null guard such as
an optional-chain segment. Null guards do not add cognitive complexity or
nesting.

**Cognitive (SonarSource):**
- +1 plus a nesting bonus for `if`, ternary, `switch`, loops, `catch`.
- +1 flat (no bonus) for `else`/`else if`, labelled `break`/`continue`, each
  run of like logical operators, and recursion (call to the enclosing
  function's own name).
- Nesting increases inside control-flow bodies and nested function bodies.

Each function-like unit is scored independently (nesting resets to 0 at the
function boundary); nested functions are reported as children rather than
inflating the parent's own score.

The rules above are stated in TypeScript/JavaScript terms; each adapter maps
its language onto the same IR, with the per-language differences below.

### Rust (`--lang rust`)
- **Function-like units:** `fn` / `impl` methods / trait default methods /
  closures.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else`, `match` (a `_` or
  bare-binding arm is the non-decision `default`), `for`/`while`/`loop`,
  labelled `break`/`continue`, and `&&`/`||`.
- No ternary (`if` is an expression) and no `try`/`catch` (errors flow through
  `?`) — those constructs simply don't occur.

### Go (`--lang go`)
- **Function-like units:** top-level functions / methods / function literals
  (closures).
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else`, `for` (including
  `for`-`range`), `switch`/type-`switch`/`select` (a `default` clause is the
  non-decision arm), labelled `break`/`continue`/`goto`, and `&&`/`||`.
- No ternary and no `try`/`catch` (errors are returned values) — those
  constructs simply don't occur.

### PHP (`--lang php`)
- **Function-like units:** functions / methods / closures / `fn` arrow
  functions / property hooks.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`elseif`/`else`, `while`/`do`-`while`/
  `for`/`foreach`, `switch` and the `match` expression (a `default` arm is the
  non-decision case), `catch` clauses, multi-level `break N`/`continue N` and
  `goto`, the ternary `?:`, and `&&`/`and`/`||`/`or`/`??`.
- `&&`/`and` (likewise `||`/`or`) are the same normalized operator. `??` folds
  as a coalescing run.
- Each null-safe property or method access (`?->`) adds one cyclomatic path.

### Ruby (`--lang ruby`)
- **Function-like units:** methods, blocks, and lambdas.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** branches, loops, `case`/`when` and
  `case`/`in`, rescue clauses, ternary expressions, logical operators.
- Each safe navigation operator (`&.`) adds one cyclomatic path.

### Kotlin (`--lang kotlin`)
- **Function-like units:** `fun` declarations / methods / local functions /
  `fun` anonymous functions / lambdas / property `get`/`set` accessors.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** the `if` expression (`else if` — an `if`
  nested in the `else` body — chains flat), the `when` expression with or
  without a subject (its `else` entry is the non-decision `default` arm),
  `for`/`while`/`do`-`while`, `catch` clauses, labelled `break@`/`continue@`,
  and `&&`/`||`.
- The elvis operator `?:` folds as a coalescing run (like PHP's `??`). Kotlin
  has no C-style ternary — `if` is already an expression.
- Each safe-navigation operator (`?.`) adds one cyclomatic path.

### Python (`--lang python`)
- **Function-like units:** `def` (incl. `async def` and decorated
  definitions) / methods / `lambda`.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`elif`/`else` (`elif` chains flat), the
  conditional expression `a if b else c` (a ternary — its `else` arm is not a
  second increment), `for`/`while` (incl. `async for`; a loop's `else` clause
  runs at the surrounding level), `match` (a bare `case _:` is the
  non-decision `default` arm), `except`/`except*` clauses, and `and`/`or`.
- Comprehensions and generator expressions score like the written-out loop:
  each `for` clause is a loop and each `if` clause a branch, nested
  left-to-right.
- No labelled `break`/`continue` and no `??`. `not` adds nothing.

### Zig (`--lang zig`)
- **Function-like units:** named `fn` declarations and `test` blocks.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else`, `while`/`for` (a
  loop's `else` branch runs at the surrounding level), `switch` (an `else`
  prong is the non-decision `default` arm), `catch` handlers, labelled
  `break`/`continue`, and `and`/`or`.
- `orelse` folds as a coalescing run. Zig has no ternary expression — `if` is
  already an expression.

### C (`--lang c`)
- **Function-like units:** function definitions, including K&R-style
  definitions and GNU nested functions.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else`, the ternary `?:`
  (GNU's elided-middle `a ?: b` included), `for`/`while`/`do`-`while`,
  `switch` (the `default:` label is the non-decision arm; each fall-through
  `case` label is its own cyclomatic point), `goto` (one flat cognitive
  point — like a labelled jump), and `&&`/`||`.
- Preprocessor conditionals (`#if`/`#ifdef`/`#ifndef`, chained via
  `#elif`/`#else`) score as branches, mirroring the SonarSource C/C++
  analyzers.
- No exceptions and no `??`. `#define` bodies are opaque to the grammar, so
  code inside a macro body is not scored.
- Known wart of preprocessor-unaware parsing: the standard `extern "C" {`
  guard splits its braces across two `#ifdef __cplusplus` blocks, which
  surfaces as a parse warning — the rest of the header still parses and
  scores.
- Another wart: the `<cinttypes>` printf-width macros (`"..." PRIu32 "..."`
  and friends) only become adjacent string literals after macro expansion,
  which the grammar never performs, so they also surface as a parse warning
  local to that expression.

### C++ (`--lang cpp`)
- Everything above for C applies unchanged (`tree-sitter-cpp`'s grammar is a
  superset of `tree-sitter-c`'s, sharing the same node kinds/fields for what
  the two languages have in common).
- **Function-like units:** additionally, a `[...](...){...}` lambda is its own
  unit (like a closure elsewhere).
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** additionally, `catch` clauses (the `try` body
  runs at the surrounding level, same as Kotlin/Python's `catch`/`except`)
  and range-`for` (`for (auto &x : xs)`), which is a loop like any other.
- Constructor/destructor/operator-overload names, including out-of-line
  qualified definitions (`Foo::bar`), are dug out of the declarator chain, as
  are functions returning a reference (`int &get()`), conversion operators
  (named e.g. `operator bool`), and explicit specializations (`spec<int>` is
  named `spec`). A qualified definition and a qualified or unqualified
  self-call both resolve to the same trailing simple name, and template
  arguments are dropped on both sides (`fact<N - 1>()` inside `fact`), so
  recursion is still detected.
- C++20 module units (`.cppm`/`.ixx`) aren't claimed: the grammar can't parse
  `export module`/`import` declarations.
- **C++ headers in `.h` files.** `.h` is routed to C by default, and when two
  languages claim the same extension the one registered first (C) wins — so
  to analyze `.h` as C++, add `h` to `cpp` *and* drop it from `c`:

  ```toml
  [ext]
  c = ["c"]
  cpp = ["cpp", "cc", "cxx", "hpp", "hh", "hxx", "h++", "tpp", "ipp", "h"]
  ```

  or on the command line, `--ext c=c --ext cpp=cpp,cc,cxx,hpp,hh,hxx,h++,tpp,ipp,h`.
  In a C++-only project, `--exclude-lang c` plus the `cpp` override works too.
- Extension matching is case-insensitive, so `.C` (a traditional C++
  extension on case-sensitive filesystems) is analyzed as C.

### Perl (`--lang perl`)
- **Function-like units:** named `sub`s / `method` declarations (feature
  `class`, Perl 5.38+) / anonymous `sub`s. A block callback passed to
  `grep`/`map`/`sort` is its own anonymous unit (like a Ruby block).
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`elsif`/`else` (`elsif` chains flat) and
  `unless`, the statement modifiers `EXPR if/unless COND` (a branch) and
  `EXPR while/until/for COND` (a loop — incl. `do { } while`), the ternary
  `?:`, `while`/`until`/C-style `for`/`foreach`, `try`/`catch` (Perl 5.34+'s
  `try` feature — `finally` runs at the surrounding level), labelled
  `next`/`last`/`redo`, and `&&`/`and`/`||`/`or`/`//`.
- `&&`/`and` (likewise `||`/`or`) are the same normalized operator. `//`
  folds as a coalescing run.
- A classic `eval { }` is transparent (the `if ($@)` after it is the decision
  point). `xor`/`not`/`!` add nothing. `given`/`when` (long deprecated) is
  not scored.

### Swift (`--lang swift`)
- **Function-like units:** `func` declarations / methods / local functions /
  closures / `init` / `deinit` / `subscript` / computed-property `get`/`set`
  accessors (including the implicit getter-only form) / `willSet`/`didSet`
  observers.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else` (with `if let` /
  `if case` variants), `guard` … `else` (scored exactly like an `if`),
  `switch` (its `default` entry is the non-decision arm; `case a, b:` is one
  arm), `for`-`in` (its `where` clause adds nothing by itself), `while`/
  `repeat`-`while`, `catch` blocks, labelled `break`/`continue`, the ternary
  `a ? b : c`, and `&&`/`||`.
- Nil-coalescing `??` folds as a coalescing run (like PHP's `??`).
- `#if` compilation directives are transparent — every branch's code scores
  where it stands. `try`/`try?`/`await` add nothing.
- Each optional-chaining guard on a member access, subscript, or call adds
  one cyclomatic path.

### Java (`--lang java`)
- **Function-like units:** methods (incl. ones in anonymous classes and
  interface `default` methods) / constructors / record compact constructors /
  lambdas. Static and instance initializer blocks run at the surrounding
  level.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else` (`else if` chains
  flat), the ternary `?:`, `switch` statements and expressions alike — both
  colon-style `case:` groups and arrow-style `case ->` rules with pattern
  matching and guards supported (a `default` or `case null, default` arm is
  the non-decision case), `for`/enhanced `for`/`while`/`do`-`while`, `catch`
  clauses (a multi-catch `catch (A | B e)` is one clause; `try`-with-resources
  bodies are transparent), labelled `break L`/`continue L`, and `&&`/`||`.
- No `??`-style coalescing operator.

### Dart (`--lang dart`)
- **Function-like units:** top-level and local functions, methods, getters,
  setters, constructors, factory constructors, operators, and anonymous
  function expressions.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else`, the ternary `?:`,
  `for` (including `await for`)/`while`/`do`-`while`, switch statements and
  switch expressions (a `default` or wildcard arm is the non-decision case),
  `catch` and `on` handlers, labelled `break`/`continue`, and `&&`/`||`.
- Pattern `&&`/`||` use the same logical-sequence rules. Collection
  `if`/`for` lower to nested branches/loops. `??`/`??=` map to coalescing
  logical nodes.
- Null-aware access (`?.`, `?[]`, `?..`), null-aware spread (`...?`),
  collection elements (`?value`), and map keys/values each add one
  cyclomatic path without adding cognitive complexity.
- External, native, and otherwise bodyless declarations are not reported as
  functions.

### Scala (`--lang scala`)
- **Function-like units:** `def` definitions (and bodyless abstract `def`
  declarations), anonymous functions (`x => …`), and partial-function
  literals (`xs.collect { case … }`, `def receive = { case … }` — an
  anonymous unit whose body is the pattern match). A secondary constructor
  (`def this(…)`) is reported as a `constructor` unit (like the Kotlin/Swift
  adapters), and its mandatory `this(…)` self-delegation is not counted as
  recursion.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`else if`/`else`, `match` (a bare
  `case _ =>`, or a lowercase variable pattern like `case other =>`, is the
  non-decision `default` arm; an uppercase stable-id like `case None =>` stays
  a decision), `for`/`while`/`do`-`while`, each `catch` clause (the `try` body
  and `finally` run at the surrounding level; the `case` handlers inside a
  `catch` score within that one node), and `&&`/`||`.
- A pattern guard (`case x if a && b =>`) is transparent: its operators still
  contribute, but the guard itself is not a separate decision.
- A lone unguarded arm that only destructures — `{ case (k, v) => … }` or
  `t match { case (a, b) => … }` (tuples of variables / `_`, nested or bound
  with `@`) — is not a decision: it is Scala's idiom for unpacking a tuple, so
  it adds no `match` increment and its body scores directly. With more than
  one arm, a tuple pattern is an ordinary refutable case.
- No `break`/`continue` statements (nor labelled loops) and no `??`-style
  coalescing operator. The library-based escapes —
  `scala.util.control.Breaks` (`breakable {}` / `break()`) and Scala 3's
  `scala.util.boundary` — are ordinary method calls, so they are not treated
  as jumps and add nothing to the score.

### Shell (`--lang shell`)

POSIX `sh` and `bash` (the first-party `tree-sitter-bash` grammar). `.sh`,
`.bash`, `.bats`, `.ksh`, and `.command` are analyzed. `zsh` has its own adapter
(`cccc-zsh`) — the bash grammar cannot parse zsh-only syntax.

- **Function-like units:** every `function_definition` — `foo() { … }`,
  `function foo { … }`, and `function foo() { … }` all become a `function` unit
  named from the definition. Shell functions nest, so a function defined inside
  another is its own unit and does not inflate the enclosing function's score.
- **Maps to the shared nodes:** `if`/`elif`/`else` (the grammar does not field
  the `then` boundary, so the split is found at the `then` keyword); `for`,
  `select`, `while`, `until`, and C-style `for (( … ))` (the
  condition/initializer/update score inside the loop, as in the other
  adapters); `case` (each arm is a `case_item`; a catch-all `*)` arm is the
  non-decision default); the arithmetic ternary `?:` inside `(( … ))`; and
  `&&`/`||` runs.
- **Logical folding:** a run of like operators is one node. This covers shell
  `list` nodes (`a && b && c`), `&&`/`||` inside `[[ … ]]` and `(( … ))`, and
  POSIX `[ a -a b -o c ]` (`-a`/`-o` in a `binary_expression` are the logical
  operators; a unary `-a` is file-existence and does not count).
- **Jumps:** `break N` / `continue N` with `N > 1` scores like a labelled jump
  (one flat cognitive point, no nesting bonus); plain `break` / `continue` /
  `return` score nothing. `! cmd` (`negated_command`) adds nothing.
- **Transparent:** subshells, brace groups, pipelines, command substitutions,
  process substitutions, redirections, variable assignments, and heredocs.
  The body of a heredoc is data, but a `command_substitution` inside it is
  still reached. Shell has no exception construct, so `trap` is an ordinary
  command.
- **Recursion** is detected by simple command name, so a function called via
  its own name (`fib …` or inside `$(fib …)`) adds one cognitive point per
  call.
- **Discovery is extension-based, with shebang detection for extensionless
  files** (see [Usage](#usage)): `bin/deploy` with `#!/bin/sh` is analyzed like
  `deploy.sh`; a `zsh` shebang routes to the `zsh` adapter instead.

### Zsh (`--lang zsh`)

`zsh` (the community `georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh` grammar, a reworking of the
bash grammar). `.zsh` files are analyzed. The control-flow skeleton is shared
with the shell adapter via `cccc-shell-kit`; zsh-only constructs are handled on
top of it:

- **Maps to the shared nodes:** the same `if`/`elif`/`else`, `case` (including
  zsh's `;|` fallthrough), `&&`/`||`, recursion, and `break N`/`continue N`
  handling as [Shell](#shell---lang-shell).
- **zsh-only loops:** `repeat n do … done` (and the `repeat n cmd` short form),
  the terse `for x (a b c) …`, and a standalone `select … do … done` all map to
  `Node::Loop`.
- **Transparent:** `{ … } always { … }` (an `always` block is a `finally`, so it
  is not a decision point), `coproc`, and anonymous `() { … }` functions
  (reported as `<function>`, with no recursion name).
- **Known grammar limitation:** the braceless short forms
  `if [[ … ]] { … }` / `while … { … }` have no rule in this grammar, so they
  surface as parse errors (reported in the summary); the `then … fi` form is
  required. As a less battle-tested grammar than `tree-sitter-bash`, advanced
  zsh (parameter-expansion flags, glob qualifiers) may also produce parse
  errors — these are surfaced, never fatal.
